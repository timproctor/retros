1406: You worked hard on Blogger & ContactManager over the past week. Did you 
do them "well"? How do you know? What things do you feel strong in, and which feel week?

I could have worked harder this week. I think I felt like, "Oh, we have a major 
project starting up soon, so I'm going to have to put in a million hours, so I
better just take it easy."  The correct mindset should have been, "Oh, we have a 
major project starting up soon, so I better work hard at learning Blogger and
ContactManager, so I don't have to sweat the hours on the major project." I feel
good with the ideas behind the pieces, like I know pretty much what each piece is
for but I don't really know how to connect the dots on my own. I'm not sure about
the rspec syntax, or how to really just build things without relying on tutorial
code or my own that was based on the tutorial.
