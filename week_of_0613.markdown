Questions for Thinking
This week the level of difficulty stepped up a bit. Did you feel ready? What
strategies did you use to cope/succeed? We've talked a lot over the past week
about objects, methods, and the Ruby Object Model. Is that making sense or
still confusing? Why? What parts have clicked and which are troubling?
You spent almost the whole week working in pairs. How has that gone?
Anyone you've particularly loved working with? Why? How can you be the person
that others love to work with? How are you managing your personal schedule?
Are you being efficient with your commute, time at school, and rest/sleep?
What can you improve? How is programming, in general, matching up with your
expectations? Do you think this is something you'll be doing ten years from now?

Week 2 was a bit of a ramp up from week 1. We started to work on more complex
Ruby. My pairing with Alan on CSV-1 was very helpful. We both went at a
comfortable pace for both of us. Alan worked on his screen and I worked on
mine. The key to our organization was frequent check-ins. Like, "I'm about
to test my integration again or my phone book test is blowing up." Whenever he
or I stumbled and we couldn't make sense of our errors - we would then
screen share to get past the block. We both struggled with the idea of
"self" methods and we I like that we took the time to discuss our thoughts about
it. Another helpful strategy of our pairing was every 25 minutes we would take
a 5 minute break. Even though it was a long day of pairing, with the breaks, the
day progressed nicely. I hope that my pairing with Alan will be the model for
the rest of my pairing.

The actual content of the CSV exercises were hard to grasp because of all of
the objects and tests that we had to create. Adding in the Mock compounded the
difficulty level of the model. I am looking forward to the week ahead and
ironing out for myself a lot of the new ideas presented to us in the CSV
exercises.

My wife has been a superhero when it comes to managing things with a husband
that leaves early and comes home late. I used to help put our two boys to bed
but now that I am coming home late, she has taken on that extra responsibility.
She has also taken on a lot of the chores that I used to do but now I neglect
to do because of time. I recall an email that Jeff sent to me after I had
accepted the offer to come to Turing. I think I said something like, "I'm
excited to work my ass off," or something to that affect and his reply really
rattled me. He said something like, "You will need that work ethic, because
to be honest I think this program will be really difficult for you." At first,
I was thinking, "Wait, does he really not want me to attend Turing but for
some reason I was allowed to attend?" For weeks, I was plagued with the
nagging idea that somehow I would fail at Turing because it would be too
difficult. I guess that is still a possibility, since we are only in week 2.
I am not as worried about it because I am putting in the work and I think that
is the deciding factor. If you are someone like me who has not been in
technology then, you have to just put in the hours. Everyday, I work from
about 9 to 8 on coding. Now, I do take the occasional glance at my email but
when I say I'm working - I'm working. My phone is off, I check emails maybe
a max of three times during the day and I force myself to stay current with
current news around during via Slack. I may not be the best programmer here but
I would give anyone here a run for their money on my drive, work-ethic, and
committment to see this thing through.

One of my fears was that I would have to repeat the first 6 weeks or worse, be
asked to leave. I don't worry about those fears anymore. I can see that I
am learning and I am adapting. Small steps in the coding world mean big things
in the long run. Small means tackling the first error message on your MiniTest
before creating your .rb file. The feedback on my TDD assessment was helpful
this week. I have really put into practice the idea of "minimum implementation
for a passing test." I have made huge strides in reading error and fail message.
I have learned about how to read the MiniTest tests. I know what my weaknesses
are. I know that I still struggle with values that default to 0 versus those
that default to nil and having the right instance variables to account for
those different assertions. I learned that a default to 0 means that an
instance variable that works as a counter is better than using an array. The
flip story is that an array is good for any defaults of true or nil. This is
one example of many that illustrate how I continue to learn and develop my
engineering skills.

The key to a lot that I learned this week comes from asking for help early and
often. If I have spent 30 minutes on the same exact error or fail message, then
that is 20 minutes of wasted time. Success for me has come through asking for
help and learning from it. For someone with my background, I need the help
and support of our Turing team. They have been awesome.
