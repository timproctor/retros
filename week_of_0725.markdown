How did you spend your intermission week? Was it the right choice? Are you
seeing benefits this week?
How did it feel to be back in action? Were you satisfied with your work on IdeaBox?
Earlier this week Jeff sent an email about roles in the group. What's your
role? What do people expect from you? How are you enhancing their learning
experience? How are they enhancing yours?

I met with my mentor for five days during the break. We decided to build a
reversi game app. My mentor did most of the Sinatra set up. We didn't finish
the project but doing that in combination with the assigned reading helped
get me prepared. Was it enough preparation? My head is still swimming with all
the different facets we have neen learning like models, views, HTML, CSS, and
Sinatra. I've got a pretty good start on the concepts but I have an ocean of
understanding to still traverse.

This leads me into my project. I was happy about the following:
- I integrated HAML and SMS features
- I was able to demo the SMS feature with moderate success

Things I wasn't happy about:
- The CSS integration was like third-grader work. It looked unprofessional
- There was no log-in functionality

....hmmmmm.....my role?

Here are my ideas on establishing a role:

- To thine own self be true: Learn about yourself
- Be that self as you understand him/her
- Be open to that understanding of self changing over time
- Love others as yourself: give yourself without asking for anything back
- Fear, like Yoda said leads to suffering: be honest with what you are afraid of

....so now my role is this:

- To live out my 5 ideas as stated above
- To make every interaction with people an opportunity to transmit my 5 ideas
  and to get back the ideas I think that someone else is trying to transmit
- To integrate other's ideas as I find them suitable to my understanding of self

was all of that too 'left-field' to make any sense?
