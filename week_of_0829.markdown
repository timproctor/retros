### Did you accomplish what you set out to do over the past six weeks?

I would have spent more time learning rails tutorials.

### Where's your confidence level in your skills? What was the low-point over the
### six week segment? High point?

My confidence continues to grow. The low-point this last six weeks was taking
time away from project time to pass my assessment. I let my team down, in my
opinion. The high point was when I paired with Jeff.

### What did you learn about our scoring (personal assessments, project evaluations)
### during the class, and how did that influence your personal motivation? What are
### the keys to keeping you invested in your work?

I thinkd the personal assessments and project evaluations are getting better.
They are still subjective, but the way the rubric is set-up continues to improve.

### What are you looking forward to about the next class? Why? What are you most
### worried about?

I worry most about other team-members having a less than thrilled reaction, if
I'm apart of their team. I have this fear, because I would think twice if a team
member was always coming close to not passing their assessments.
