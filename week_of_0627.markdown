EventReporter: What did you think about pairing with the same person for a whole
week? What were the plusses and minuses? Do you think you carried your weight?
Were you a good person to work with?
As you go into your first 10-day project next week, what will you try to do the
same and what will you try to do differently?
We're four weeks in as of today, 23 left. Are you on a pace you can sustain?
Are you managing your schedule effectively? What outside factors will influence
your success?


I was lucky with EventReporter. My pair was very communicative about her
expectations. We were able to begin each session with a sharing of our expectations
for the day, for example, how long we wanted to work, what we hoped to
accomplish in our pairing, how we would pair (who would drive and who would
navigate), and even how often we would take breaks. I think I carried my weight.
My pair was more confident with how TDD and object oriented programming works and
I felt I had a better handle on Ruby style. My pair seemed to work well in
the morning but towards the five o'clock hour, she was tired. I was not much
help during the morning but I was more alert in the evening. This was a good
compromise for us. I felt I was a good person to work with but I don't really
know. There were times when I felt like my pair was doing her best to be nice
even though she may have felt some frustration.

As we move into our first 10-day project, I have some thoughts on what to do
differently and what strategies I will keep.

What strategies I will keep:

 * writing out a game-plan: a top-down model that I build from the bottom-up
 * writing tests: baby-steps progress to guide design
 * making small steps towards the larger picture
 * using de-bugging techniques like binding.pry
 * asking for help when I know I'm stuck

What things I will do differently:

 * for TDD; I want to start with a higher level feature test that will break
   and that will take me down into various unit tests
 * "In a perfect world" tests that are not worried about implementation
 * When all the unit tests begin to the pass, go back to the feature test
 * I will try and write out more plain English text for starter code

The next big project is called sales-engine. My goal is to get the same high
marks that my pair and I received on event-reporter as well as improved Ruby
style grades.
