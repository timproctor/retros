Dinner Dash is your first Rails project. Did you feel that the previous tutorials
prepared you for this project? What are the challenges of working in bigger teams?
What can you improve in your workflow?

**Yes, the tutorials were a huge help. I just wish I had time-managed the tutorials
better.

What can you improve in your workflow?

**The challenge for our team of four was to change what we were doing. The first
week we thought it would be a better work flow to go off in pairs. The pairs
would work on their own branches and then we would come together and merge.

Josh pointed out to us that getting our app functional is the priority, which
would mean that we would all need the most-up-to-date master. So, instead of pushing
to master once a week - our challenge was to push to master a couple of times
a day AND to pull from master whenever someone pushed.

We have worked in this new workflow for about two days and the change is AMAZING!
We have almost a fully functioning site where two days ago, I wasn't sure we
would have anything. One can literally watch our app GROW!

Your assessment is coming next week. Do you feel prepared? What is your strategy
going to be?

**I have no strategy except to apply the problem solving techniques Jeff steered
me towards and the ones I see Josh using. I am what I am.
