### Do you feel your teams are still properly organized? Are you still holding stand-up
### meetings, writing user stories and updating Waffle?

I believe that our team is properly organized and that we are doing what should
be expected of novices. What good is a stand-up if you are not aware of what is
important to a stand-up? What good is a user stories and updating Waffle if you
don't have a good sense of how to make the best use of such tools? I think the answer
is that as novices we will use, fail, learn, use, fail, learn...our tools.

### How much progress have you made on The Pivot? Have you discussed with your
### team the pending work? What's your strategy for finishing strong?

We had a very productive first week but our second week was not as productive.
I agree with Jeff's assessment that our project will probably be done when we are
suppose to launch. The downside is though, that we won't really have any crazy-cool
features ready do go.

### Now that you have finished more than half of the program, are you getting
### nostalgic? Are there any skills that you want to improve? What are you doing
### to set a lasting impression among your peers?

I still very behind in my rails knowledge. I have started to just read the Rails Guide for
fun. When I get some time, I would like to build something in Rails that is small, but
gives me practice at certain Rails things.

### What are you doing to integrate the 1409 cohort? Are you pairing with them?
### Are you providing some mentorship and guidance?

I like to introduce myself to new faces at first. I have yet to pair with anyone from
1409 but they all seem like a great bunch of programmers.
