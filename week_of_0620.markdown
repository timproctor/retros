Mastermind: how did your project turn out? Why? If you could rewind to this time
last week, what would you do the same and what would you do differently? What
did you learn through the project? One of the class sessions this week was on
debugging. Were you able to apply those techniques to your project? What
tools / strategies did you use to fix things when they were burning down?
You didn't have an assigned pair or group for this project. Did you choose to
work on your own, with others, or a mix? How did that work out? Why? As you
start into the next project with a pair, what are you excited about or wary of?
Now that you've been together for a few weeks you have a sense of your
classmates. Who do you click with? Who do you find difficult to work with?
What kind of strategies will you use when you need to work with people who you
don't naturally mesh with?
