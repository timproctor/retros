How has SalesEngine progressed so far? Have you been able to track the goals
you set out for at the beginning of the project?
As you look back at our first five weeks, what topics are you feeling good about?
Which are still shakey?
The first class assessment is early next week. What parts will you excel, and
what will you struggle with? What should/could you do to prepare?
We have 22 more weeks together. How will you take advantage of the people
around you to accelerate your learning? How will you accelerate theirs?

The target goals that we set as we began SalesEngine have been daily met. We
are on Day4 going into a 3 day weekend. So far, Tan and I, have done a good
job tracking our progress.

I have mixed feeling as I look back at the last 5 weeks. Topics that I have come
a long way with are:

* using git to save progress, branching, and merging
* using GitHub as a repository for group assignments, saving work, and practicing
  open source
* using and establishing quick keys
* Ruby syntax and searching libraries to find build-in methods

But areas that I feel that I have not progressed enough in are:

* TDD
* Refactoring
* finding the right built-in method for the enumerable job
* this idea of self
* using modules and blocks
* instantiating and communicating with multiple objects

With testing on the horizon, I think I will excel in:

* Ruby Style
* Communication/Pairing

and I think I will struggle with:

* TDD (actually making good tests)
* Object Oriented model of Ruby (manipulating and communicating with multiple
  objects)

I need to ask questions about the assessment, like how can I prepare or what is
it going to be like. I think my mentors could be utilized more. I need to reach
out to them more often.

I continue to ask questions when I struggle, I think most of us do a really good
job at just talking about what we struggle with and bouncing ideas around. I
hope that I continue to be a help to others but I really don't know if I am. I
seem to be more on the getting vs giving information side. I am really good at
listening and asking questions when someone is giving me help.
