Retros is a collection of all of my weekly Retrospectives from my time at
Turing School of Software and Design.

Since I am putting these on GitHub, I am fully aware that there is the cosmic
chance that someone, somewhere, might read one or two. I am hoping that a
Turing/Jumpstart Lab hopeful student will read these as he or she considers
attending a code school.
