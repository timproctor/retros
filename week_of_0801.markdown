CloneWars was both a short project and the first time most people had worked in
a group of three. How did it go? Did you get 50% more work done than if there
had just been two of you?
What work styles feel most comfortable to you? Many groups went for three-person
mob programming. Was it worth the person hours to have three people working together?
Were you happy with the outcomes of the project? If you could go back to Monday,
what would you do differently? The same? What did you learn about the people in
your group?
Was it exciting to build a first legit web application? Where do you see your
skills headed from here? What do you look forward to about the next projects?

The difficulty of working with three people is that it is harder to program in
one direction. To make the experience more effective, I think the group needs
to be diligent at setting up group expectations like:
* who is the driver?
* who is the navigator?
* who is the task-master?
Then the group needs to set short objectives for the day, and evaluate what
the next objectives will be. These are tricky ideas to navigate when you add on
members of a team. Pairing is ideal, 3, 4, or more people does not triple, or
quadruple the speed at which work can get done.

I liked that our group did mob programming, because given our skill levels - that
is what we needed to do. We could have been better organized with our
objectives and more on point with setting group roles. If we could go back to
Monday, I would have liked to have seen more planning and role setting.

We should have gone through the assignment rubric in a more methodical, problem
solving style. I think we lost the forrest from the trees and as a result we
spun our wheels a lot. We bounced around from moment to moment in our testing, or
we didn't test enough, in general - we were too tunnel visioned in our approach,
too unfocused, and too unorganized.

I admit that our group of 3 failed at the assignment but there is value in failure.
I learned more about the MVC approach and I learned that I have a long way
to go in understanding MVC. I need to take some time to just go over MVC code until
things start clicking in my mind. I wish I had been able to contribute more to
our group - there were many times when I felt like I was dead weight. There
were moments of clarity during the project, which were very exciting and
encouraging. I look forward to the continued sharpening of my pairing, programming,
and MVC coding skills.
