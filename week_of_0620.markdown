Mastermind: how did your project turn out? Why? If you could rewind to this time
last week, what would you do the same and what would you do differently? What
did you learn through the project? One of the class sessions this week was on
debugging. Were you able to apply those techniques to your project? What
tools / strategies did you use to fix things when they were burning down?
You didn't have an assigned pair or group for this project. Did you choose to
work on your own, with others, or a mix? How did that work out? Why? As you
start into the next project with a pair, what are you excited about or wary of?
Now that you've been together for a few weeks you have a sense of your
classmates. Who do you click with? Who do you find difficult to work with?
What kind of strategies will you use when you need to work with people who you
don't naturally mesh with?

I have a lot of thoughts on Mastermind. I will try and put these thoughts into
some kind of order:

a) What I liked
b) What I didn't
c) What I would do differently
d) What I learned about TDD
e) Limitations, can drive learning

a) What I liked

I am new to programming and anything tech, in general. It's 2014 and I have yet
to own or have ever owned a 'smart' phone as an example. I really thought is
was cool that I could go to the command line and type "ruby mastermind.rb" and
my game creation would boot up, exactly as I had designed it to do. I liked how
I was able to do a lot of "debugging" just by playing the game over and over.
I was able to fix these issues:
- quitting the game at any point
- looping back to the original menu
- re-setting the number of guesses and times, when the user quit and then
  restarted a game

Fixing these issues really made me feel like a programming "bad-ass."

b) What I didn't like

I hated the following about my game or program:

- I was unable to solve the issue of needed to quit three times to actually
  leave the game
- I was unable to refactor code I new could be refactored
- I was unable to use enumerable methods that would have cleaned up my code
- The architecture of my code was not a good example of "top-down" and I didn't
  know how to fix that

c) What I would do differently

- Spend more time in the beginning, planning - by planning I mean pencil to
  paper the following programming concepts:
      * "top-down" structure
      * psuedo-code in English what I want to accomplish
      * searching for solutions before trying to build one

d) What I learned about TDD

- With a better pre-planning comes better TDD
- When you want to make a change - CHANGE the TEST FIRST!!!
- Learn how to mock/stub

e) Limitations, can drive learning

is the idea that now I can look at the things I hated, would do differently,
or TDD lessons and apply them to the next project. This will provide a
structure to my learning process.
