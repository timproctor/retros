Are you satisfied with your progress so far? Is this where you thought you'd be
after six weeks? What factors are controlling your degree of success? Which of
those can you control, and which will you control differently in the next class?
What do you consider your top three achievements from the first six weeks and
why? What do you expect to achieve in the next class?
Where do you think you rank in your class? What's your evidence? Do you think
you're moving up, sliding back, or holding steady?
What's your plan for intermission week? Who will you work with to ensure you're
learning during the week? How will you know if your efforts are successful?
Who have been the top three influencers on you so far? How did they support
your learning? Why do you match up with them? What do they do that helps you?

Here are some thoughts on the last 6 weeks:
* I need to construct a work-out plan that includes enumerable exercises on a
  consistent basis.
* Big achievements: We finished Sales Engine, I passed by the skin-of-my-teeth,
  I started understanding Modules as mix-ins.
* Still-to-go: I want to get more comfortable with ActiveRecord, enumerables,
  blocks, and typing more like a programmer.

Where do I rank?
It's funny that this question is being asked. It is an example of the
mixed messages that we get as students from some of the instructors. When I say
in my one-on-ones that I often compare my abilities with others in the class,
the feedback from instructors is that I shouldn't worry about comparing myself.
But here we are, being asked to compare ourselves. Ok. Well, I think I'm somewhere
in the middle. I know a lot of Ruby API compared to some, though, ironically
that's the score that almost set me back 6 weeks. I feel like for the most part,
our class is pretty evenly matched. We have one or two ringers, we have some
that started out at the bottom but have started to gain some serious momentum.
I don't know where I am and I don't really concern myself with it. I know that
I have a programmers heart, I have desire, I have determination, and I am a
capable learner. I should not have been on the chopping block this week except
I suck in interviews or assessments. I know that there is really no way out -
I need to be less sucky at interviews or assessments. I am going to continue to
ignore the question of where I rank and I am just going to keep my eye on the
end game. This program is all about getting a job in programming. In the end, I
don't give a fuck where I rank. I know what I need to do and I'm doing it.
